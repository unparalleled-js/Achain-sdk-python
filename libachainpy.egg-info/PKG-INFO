        # achainpy library
        
        This library is still a work in progress but currently has the ability to perform all `cleos get` functions without compiling the code.
        
        The library now supports signing transactions/key creation for both python 2.7 and 3.x. This is the first iteration and is very rough. The key creation has not been tested fully and should be used at your own risk.
        
        The commands currently implemented.

        # create virtual environment
        mkdir -p ~/envs/achainpy
        virtualenv ~/envs/achainpy
        # activate the environment
        source ~/envs/achainpy/bin/activate
        # clone code
        git clone https://github.com/Achain-Dev/Achain-sdk-python.git
        # install the library
        cd Achain-sdk-python
        [sudo] python setup.py install
        
        ```
        ### Windows
        
        1. Install python
           You can use either Python 2.7 or 3.7 however we suggest python 3.7 as we have tested that version more thoroughly.
